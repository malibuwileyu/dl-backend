# Website Categories Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **JavaScript Event Handlers Not Working**
   - Problem: Inline onclick handlers weren't executing
   - Solution: Replaced inline onclick with addEventListener approach
   - Changed all buttons to use IDs and data attributes instead of onclick

2. **Duplicate Event Listener Registration**
   - Problem: Event listeners were being registered twice
   - Solution: Consolidated all event listener setup into a single setupEventListeners function

3. **Dynamic Button Events**
   - Problem: Edit and Delete buttons created dynamically weren't working
   - Solution: Used event delegation on the container to handle dynamic button clicks

## Changes Made

1. **HTML Changes**:
   - Removed all `onclick` attributes from buttons
   - Added IDs to static buttons: `logoutBtn`, `addPatternBtn`, `closeModalBtn`, `cancelModalBtn`
   - Changed dynamic buttons to use `data-id` attributes and CSS classes for identification

2. **JavaScript Changes**:
   - Created `setupEventListeners()` function to centralize event binding
   - Added event delegation for dynamically created Edit/Delete buttons
   - Moved form submission handler to a separate function
   - All initialization now happens in DOMContentLoaded event

## Testing the Fix

1. Navigate to http://localhost:4051/website-categories.html
2. Click "+ Add Pattern" - modal should appear
3. Fill in pattern and category, click Save - new pattern should be added
4. Click Edit on any row - modal should open with existing data
5. Click Delete on any row - confirmation dialog should appear and deletion should work

The page now uses proper event handling and should work correctly in all browsers.
