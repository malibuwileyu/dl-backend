## Q&A Preparation

### Anticipated Questions:

**Q: How do you categorize apps?**
A: "We use AI to categorize apps, but schools can customize. For example, Photoshop might be 'productive' for art class but 'distracting' for math."

**Q: What about student phones?**
A: "This tracks school computers only. We recommend separate mobile device policies."

**Q: Can students disable it?**
A: "The app requires admin privileges to uninstall. Students can see but not modify their tracking."

**Q: How much does it cost?**
A: "Pricing is per student per year, with volume discounts. Includes all updates and support."

**Q: What about COPPA/FERPA compliance?**
A: "We're fully compliant. Data stays on school servers, no third-party sharing, parents can request data deletion."

## Demo Troubleshooting

### If something goes wrong:

1. **No real-time updates**: Check if StudentTimeTracker app is running
2. **Charts not showing**: Refresh the page, check browser console
3. **API errors**: Ensure backend is running on port 4051
4. **No data showing**: Run the data seeding script

### Backup Plan:
- Have screenshots ready
- Pre-recorded video demonstration
- Sample API responses saved
