# App Categories Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

1. **JavaScript Event Handlers Not Working**
   - Problem: Inline onclick handlers weren't executing
   - Solution: Replaced inline onclick with addEventListener approach
   - Changed all buttons to use IDs instead of onclick

2. **Removed Scope Filter**
   - Removed the "All Scopes" dropdown filter as requested
   - Removed the Scope column from the table
   - Simplified filtering logic to only use search and category filters

3. **Fixed Dynamic Button Events**
   - Problem: Edit buttons created dynamically weren't working
   - Solution: Used event delegation on the container to handle dynamic button clicks

## Changes Made

1. **HTML Changes**:
   - Removed all `onclick` attributes from buttons
   - Added IDs to static buttons: `logoutBtn`, `addCategoryBtn`, `closeModalBtn`, `cancelModalBtn`
   - Changed dynamic Edit buttons to use `data-id` attributes and CSS classes
   - Removed scope filter dropdown
   - Removed scope column from table

2. **JavaScript Changes**:
   - Created `setupEventListeners()` function to centralize event binding
   - Added event delegation for dynamically created Edit buttons
   - Moved form submission handler to a separate function
   - Removed scope filtering logic
   - All initialization now happens in DOMContentLoaded event

## Testing the Fix

1. Navigate to http://localhost:4051/app-categories.html
2. Click "+ Add Category" - modal should appear
3. Fill in app name and category, click Save - new category should be added
4. Click Edit on any row - modal should open with existing data
5. Search and category filters should work (scope filter is removed)

The page now uses proper event handling and should work correctly in all browsers.
